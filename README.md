# Linear-Regression-Visualization
 
A from the ground up explanation of Linear Regression that provides a coding, mathematical, and visual understanding.

The notebook `LinearRegressionSCAI.ipynb` was developed as a teaching tool for students at Santa Cruz Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) at UCSC, to illustrate concepts in linear regression. A shortcut to the file can be found here:

Special shoutout to Josh Starmer and his book *The StatQuest Illustrated Guide To Machine Learning* which helped me learn these concepts which I created visualizations for! It is a great read and I definitely recommend it.

If you end up using these visualizations elsewhere, it would be great if you could credit this github or me. I hope you enjoyed the visualization ðŸ˜„
